+ natural numbers

**definition**: those are numbers used for counting (non-negative numbers).

**examples**: 0,1,2,3,4
``` 
Counting uses natural number
A set of natural number can expressed as:
N={0,1,2,3...}
```

+ integer numbers

**definition**: those are whole numbers.

**examples**: -2,-1,0,1,2
```
Fractions, surds and pi are not integers.
```

+ rational numbers

**definition**: those are numbers that can be expressed as a fraction (this includes integers as they can be written as n/n)

**examples**: 2/3, 19/328, 2/2
```
Surds, pi and imaginary/complex numbers are not rational numbers
```

+ irrational numbers

**definition**: numbers which can't be expressed as a fraction

**examples**: pi and surds

+ real numbers

**definition**: numbers which are not imaginary or complex (not the root of a negative number).

**examples**: pi, 2/3, surds, 3

+ ordinal numbers

**definition**: numbers used for positioning

**examples**: 1st, 2nd, 3rd

### 3.5.2 Number bases
+ base 2: those are binary numbers. example: 1010<sub>2</sub>. See [this site](https://bournetocode.com/projects/AQA_AS_Theory/pages/3-5.html) for more infomation
+ base 10: these are denary numbers. example: 14<sub>10</sub>.
+ base 16 these are hexidecimal numbers. example: 3F and DA.
+ conversion between denary, binary and hex

**Denary to Binary**
```
List the powers of 2 then subtract the highest power of 2 possible from your denary number and write a "1" under the power of 2, repeat until you are left with "0".

e.g.
102 to Binary
102-64=38
38-32=6
6-4=2
2-2=0
128|64|32|16|8|4|2|1
0	1  1  0  0 1 1 0
```
**Denary to Hexidecimal**
```
Convert the denary to binary then split the binary into nibbles then convert each nibble into Hexidecimal

e.g.
102 = 01100110
0110 0110
8|4|2|1
0 1 1 0

0110=6

Since both nibbles are the same

102 in denary = 66 in hex
```

### 3.5.3 Units of information
+ bit and bytes
+ units of kilo, kilbi etc

### 3.5.4 Binary number system

#### unsigned binary
#### unsigned binary arithmetics
#### signed binary with two's complement
#### fixed point form binary representation of numbers with fractional parts

### 3.5.5 Information encoding system

#### Character form of a decimal digit
#### ASCII and Unicode
#### Error checking and correction

### 3.5.6 Representing images, sound and other data

#### Bit patterns, images,  sound  and other  data
#### Analogue and digital
#### Analogue and digital conversion
#### Bitmapped graphics
#### Digital representation of sound
#### Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)
#### Data compression
#### Encryption
